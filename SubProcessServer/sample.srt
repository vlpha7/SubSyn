00:00:12,74 --> 00:00:15,6
a few years ago I felt like I was stuck 

2
00:00:15,72 --> 00:00:18,33
in a rut so I decided to follow in the 

3
00:00:18,33 --> 00:00:23,17
footsteps of the great American philosopher Morgan Spurlock and trying 

4
00:00:23,17 --> 00:00:24,77
something new for thirty days 

5
00:00:25,59 --> 00:00:27,3
The idea is actually pretty simple 

6
00:00:27,75 --> 00:00:30,15
Think about something you've always wanted to add to your 

7
00:00:30,15 --> 00:00:33,19
life and try it for the next thirty days 

8
00:00:33,94 --> 00:00:36,54
It turns out thirty days is just about the right 

9
00:00:36,54 --> 00:00:39,57
amount of time to add a new habit or subtract 

10
00:00:39,57 --> 00:00:42,45
a habit like watching the news from your life 

11
00:00:42,98 --> 00:00:44,75
There's a few things that I learned while doing these 

12
00:00:44,75 --> 00:00:45,81
thirty day challenges 

13
00:00:46,64 --> 00:00:49,95
The first was instead of the months flying by for 

14
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:50,55
gotten 

15
00:00:51,04 --> 00:00:53,45
The time was much more memorable 

16
00:00:54,13 --> 00:00:55,65
This was part of a challenge I did to take 

17
00:00:55,65 --> 00:00:58,29
a picture every day for a month and I remember 

18
00:00:58,3 --> 00:01:01,45
exactly where I was and what I was doing that 

19
00:01:01,46 --> 00:01:01,77
day 

20
00:01:03,12 --> 00:01:05,68
I also noticed that as I started to do Mohr 

21
00:01:05,68 --> 00:01:08,95
and harder thirty day challenges my self confidence grew 

22
00:01:09,56 --> 00:01:12,53
I went from desk dwelling computer nerd to the kind 

23
00:01:12,53 --> 00:01:15,55
of guy who bikes to work for fun 

24
00:01:17,24 --> 00:01:20,25
Even last year I ended up hiking up Mount Kilimanjaro 

25
00:01:20,25 --> 00:01:21,65
the highest mountain in Africa 

26
00:01:22,13 --> 00:01:25,83
I would never have been that adventurous before I started 

27
00:01:25,83 --> 00:01:26,95
my thirty day challenges 

28
00:01:28,03 --> 00:01:31,31
I also figured out that if you really want something 

29
00:01:31,31 --> 00:01:34,99
badly enough you can do anything for thirty days 

30
00:01:36,14 --> 00:01:39,77
Have you ever wanted to write a novel Every November 

31
00:01:39,89 --> 00:01:42,64
tens of thousands of people try to write their own 

32
00:01:42,64 --> 00:01:46,71
fifty thousand word novel from scratch in thirty days 

33
00:01:47,64 --> 00:01:50,27
It turns out all you have to do is write 

34
00:01:50,27 --> 00:01:52,85
sixteen hundred and sixty seven words a day for a 

35
00:01:52,85 --> 00:01:53,25
month 

36
00:01:54,54 --> 00:01:55,36
So I did 

37
00:01:56,14 --> 00:01:58,21
By the way the secret is not to go to 

38
00:01:58,21 --> 00:02:00,37
sleep until you've written your words for the day 

39
00:02:01,59 --> 00:02:04,56
You might be sleep deprived but you'LL finish your novel 

40
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:02:04,56


41
00:02:05,8 --> 00:02:06,22
Now 

42
00:02:06,51 --> 00:02:10,61
Is my book the next great American novel No I 

43
00:02:10,61 --> 00:02:11,64
wrote it in a month 

44
00:02:11,65 --> 00:02:16,81
It's awful but for the rest of my life if 

45
00:02:16,81 --> 00:02:19,53
I meet John Hodgman at a Ted party I don't 

46
00:02:19,53 --> 00:02:22,53
have to say I'm a computer scientist 

47
00:02:22,96 --> 00:02:23,44
No no 

48
00:02:23,45 --> 00:02:26,33
If I want to I can say I'm a novelist 

49
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:02:26,33


50
00:02:29,73 --> 00:02:31,62
So here's one last thing I'd like to mention 

51
00:02:32,02 --> 00:02:35,69
I learned that when I made small sustainable changes things 

52
00:02:35,69 --> 00:02:38,53
I could keep doing there were more likely to stick 

53
00:00:00,undefined --> 00:02:38,53


54
00:02:39,2 --> 00:02:41,89
There's nothing wrong with big crazy challenges 

55
00:02:41,9 --> 00:02:45,09
In fact there are a ton of fun but they're 

56
00:02:45,09 --> 00:02:46,15
less likely to stick 

57
00:02:47,22 --> 00:02:50,35
When I gave up sugar for thirty days Day thirty 

58
00:02:50,35 --> 00:02:51,45
one looked like this 

59
00:02:54,06 --> 00:02:55,47
So here's my question to you 

60
00:02:56,52 --> 00:02:59,8
What are you waiting for I guarantee you the next 

61
00:02:59,81 --> 00:03:02,46
thirty days are going to pass whether you like it 

62
00:03:02,46 --> 00:03:03,03
or not 

63
00:03:04,12 --> 00:03:07,45
So why not think about something you have always wanted 

64
00:03:07,46 --> 00:03:11,18
to try and give it a shot for the next 

65
00:03:11,18 --> 00:03:13,13
thirty days Thanks
